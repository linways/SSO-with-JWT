# SSO using JWT - PHP Example

This is a POC implementation of the concept SSO using JWT in PHP.

To run the project, you need to install composer (https://getcomposer.org/).

Run one of the following from the project directory

`composer install`  (For global composer installation)  
or   
`php composer.phar install` (For local installation)

To start the server : `php -S localhost:8000 index.php`   
You can also use apache or nginx, but you need to configure the server so that the `.htaccess` inside this project directory is considered.
